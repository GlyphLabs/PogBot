# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the usage of PogBot operated by PurpLabs. This policy explains what information is collected by the bot, how it is used and how you can control the collection and use of information.

## Information Collection

PogBot does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive information from its users. It only receives information that is necessary for its functionality, such as the commands entered by users and the context in which they are entered. This information is used solely for the purpose of providing the services offered by PogBot and is not shared with any third parties. All data that PogBot collects is public user IDs, channel IDs provided by administrative users, and other aggregated analytics that cannot be traced back to an individual user or even server (such as overall command usage, server count, total member count, etc.) 

## Data Security

PogBot takes the security of user information seriously and implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect user information against unauthorized access, use, disclosure or destruction. In the event of a data breach, users would of course be notified, even though any data that could possibly have been collected is of little to no impact (due to the fact that it is all publicly accessible).

## Data Usage

PogBot uses message content data for the bot's reaction feature. This data, however, is not stored or cached in any way. PogBot uses public user IDs to keep track of and manage the data included in the economic functionality, and this data is only collected if the user opts in by using an economy command. Provided channel IDs are only used for the chatbot functionality, and is opted into and directly provided by a server administrator.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or laws. We will notify users of any material changes to this policy through a notice in the Discord platform or other appropriate means.
